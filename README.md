About This Learning Project
===========================

• Cart Management Expertise
--------------------------------

Main target was the functional cart system, complete with addition, removal, and quantity update functionalities, By doing this it helped to understand how React hooks, Context Providers work.  
Also, using React Router on this project, like my [first React project](https://viduwaa.github.io/reactbasics-with-demo-website/) ,  was a great way to practice it again.

• TypeScript Integration
------------------------

By using TypeScript's strong typing capabilities it helped me thourghout the development process. It helped me catch errors early, and what I'm doing wrong and what should I change at that moment to understand the code properly.

• Tailwind CSS Styling
----------------------

The styling of this fully responsive website is made possible by the implementation of Tailwind CSS.  
Still new to Tailwind but It's actually kind of growing on me. It looks ugly but it feels good rather than writing custom css and naming them with proper names.

• Embracing Continuous Learning
-------------------------------

Still learning React + TS and will continue to make things for fun and improve my knowledge.  
Feel free to reach out; insights contribute to this ongoing learning journey.
